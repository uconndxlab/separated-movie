                  Across Central America a network of civil rights lawyers are
                  searching tirelessly for hundreds of parents who were deported
                  after being separated from their children under Trump’s zero
                  tolerance policy.
                  <br />
                  Three years after the family separation policy officially
                  ended, they continue to knock on doors, track down relatives,
                  and search incomplete government records to locate the parents
                  of around 490 children who remain in the United States. They
                  have already found around 500 children’s parents.
                  <br />
                  “Our goal is to make sure that the parents who were deported
                  without their kids are found, are talked to, are heard, and
                  gain control over the future of their families,” said Cathleen
                  Caron, the founder and executive director of
                  <a href="https://www.justiceinmotion.org/"
                    >Justice in Motion</a
                  >, one of the the U.S.-based nonprofits tasked with finding
                  the deported parents.
                  <br />
                  In June 2018 after nearly 5,500 children were separated from
                  their parents at the border, a federal judge in San Diego
                  mandated that the government reunify families within 30 days.
                  Federal agencies failed to meet that deadline.
                  <br />
                  “The government intentionally separated these families,
                  intentionally hurt these families and had no intention to
                  reunite them,” said Caron. “They weren’t going to do it.”
                  <br />
                  So in August 2018, the judge created a steering committee of
                  five nonprofits to find and reunify families and ordered the
                  government to turn over any information they had on the
                  children and parents. Justice in Motion is the member of that
                  committee that deals with the “unreachable” parents, ones who
                  have been impossible to reach from the U.S.. Contact
                  information for these parents is often incomplete, outdated,
                  or inaccurate, said Caron. Finding them in their country of
                  origin is complicated.
                  <br />
                  “This has been a herculean task that we have been working on
                  since the Summer of 2018,” said Caron.
                  <br />
                  Prior to 2018, Justice in Motion already had what they call a
                  defender network of 45 human rights organizations and lawyers
                  South of the border, ensuring immigrants rights were protected
                  throughout their immigration process. This network was then
                  ideal for locating parents who had been separated from their
                  children and deported back to their country of origin.
                  <br />
                  “It’s a miracle that we give defender network members bad
                  data, and they end up finding the families,” said Caron. “So
                  that’s sleuthing work that they do using local government
                  records, looking for birth certificates, looking for
                  hometowns, going to those hometowns. It’s quite complex.”
                  <br />
                  Even when the parents are located, there is often a deep
                  distrust, said Caron. Many parents are slow to trust a system
                  that tore their child away from them or do not understand the
                  role Justice in Motion plays in their reunification. That’s
                  when the local defenders are so crucial.
                  <br />
                  “These are people from their own communities who they know are
                  human rights advocates, human rights leaders,” said Caron.
                  <br />
                  Challenges such as COVID-19 and natural disasters have further
                  complicated an already difficult search, but the defender
                  network overcame these and other challenges.
                  <br />
                  “We are the last resort to find these parents,” said Caron.
                  “We are going to keep on going through the list. We have found
                  hundreds of parents so far. The list right now is down to a
                  couple hundred, and we are making progress.

                  An 18-month-old craned her neck to catch the last glimpse of
                  their wailing mother as the car drove away. A boy screamed
                  “Daddy, Daddy, what are they doing?” as border patrol agents
                  forced them apart without time for the child to receive an
                  answer. Parents waved through a glass window as their children
                  were taken away, having no idea when they would see them
                  again.
                  <br />
                  These are the stories that Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the
                  American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project, has
                  heard repeated from hundreds of immigrants separated from
                  their children under the Trump administration’s zero tolerance
                  immigration policy.
                  <br />
                  “This is the worst thing I have seen in my 30 years doing this
                  civil rights work,” said Gelernt in an interview with
                  Frontline.
                  <br />
                  Gelernt says that more than 5,500 immigrant children were
                  separated from their parents after crossing the border during
                  Trump’s tenure, a markedly different approach from previous
                  administrations who kept the majority of immigrant families
                  together. A

                    >June report</a
                  >
                  from The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that almost
                  4,000 children were separated from their parents under Trump,
                  and that the department is reviewing another 1,700 separation
                  cases. The vast majority of the separated families emigrated
                  from Central America, per the report.
                  <br />
                  “The numbers tell one story, and it’s devastating, the 5,500,”
                  said Gelernt. “But each child is a story unto himself or
                  herself.”
                  <br />
                  Gelernt is the lead attorney in Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration and
                  Customs Enforcement, which was filed in February 2018. This
                  was the first lawsuit to challenge family separation under
                  Trump, and it came two months before Jeff Sessions sent a
                  <a
                    href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1049751/download"
                    >memo</a
                  >
                  enacting a zero tolerance and family separation policy for
                  anyone who crosses the border. In the months that followed
                  that memo, family separations skyrocketed, per the DHS report.
                  <br />
                  Ms. L was separated from her daughter, S.S. in November 2017
                  after arriving in San Diego seeking asylum from the Democratic
                  Republic of the Congo. Despite entering the country legally as
                  an asylum seeker, Ms. L was kept in San Diego while her
                  daughter was brought halfway across the country to Chicago,
                  where she remained for six months with limited telephone
                  contact.
                  <br />
                  Ms. L was one of what would become 5,500 cases of family
                  separation. After an international outcry condemning the
                  practice, Gelerent successfully argued in June 2018 for the
                  federal court to mandate the end of family separation and
                  ensure family reunification within 30 days.
                  <br />
                  The Trump administration had kept haphazard and incomplete
                  records on families who had been separated and lacked any plan
                  to reunite families, said Gelernt. By the deadline, less than
                  half of the children had been reunified with their parents.
                  <br />
                  Today the parents of almost 500 separated children are still
                  missing, said Gelernt. The ACLU has been working with other
                  nonprofits to locate parents, most of whom were deported
                  without their children.
                  <br />
                  Even the children who have been reunified suffer from intense
                  emotional trauma, said Gelernt. A study published in the
                  Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics called
                  the practice “torture.”
                  <br />
                  “In the history books it needs to say flat out that the Trump
                  administration engaged in child abuse of thousands and
                  thousands of children,” said Gelernt.
                  <br />
                  Gelernt and his team continue to litigate the Ms. L case,
                  arguing that families who were separated should be granted
                  permanent status in the U.S., receive basic necessities, and
                  get the trauma help they need.
                  <br />
                  “Will the children ever recover from what’s happened?” said
                  Gelernt. “I suspect a lot of them will not, I think that is
                  what the medical community is saying. But we need to try. We
                  need to do everything we can.”
