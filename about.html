                This site is a collaborative effort by a group of researchers,
                videographers, journalists, and web designers at the University
                of Connecticut, Syracuse University, and Frontline PBS. This
                project chronicles the discreet start of the Trump
                Administrationâ€™s family separation policy, explores the
                lingering effects of its implementation, and highlights the
                efforts to reunite families through present-day. The stories
                here preview a Frontline PBS documentary that will tell the
                stories of families yet to be reunited three years later. The
                film will be released Fall 2021.
