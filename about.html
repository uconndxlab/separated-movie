                This site is a collaborative effort by a group of researchers,
                videographers, journalists, and web designers at the University
                of Connecticut, Syracuse University, and Frontline PBS. This
                project chronicles the discreet start of the Trump
                Administration’s family separation policy, explores the
                lingering effects of its implementation, and highlights the
                efforts to reunite families through present-day. The stories
                here preview a Frontline PBS documentary that will tell the
                stories of families yet to be reunited three years later. The
                film will be released Fall 2021.
