                  On April 6th, 2018 Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the
                  criminal prosecution any immigrant who enters the United
                  States illegally. Under this policy, immigrant families
                  travelling with minors would be separated. As a new
                  administration takes over, they face an urgent challenge: how
                  to reunite the hundreds of migrant children who remain
                  separated from their families.

              <h2>Synopsis</h2>
              <p>
                It was the most shocking part of the Trump administration’s
                "zero tolerance” approach to immigration: family separation.
                While it was in effect, thousands of children were forcibly
                taken from their parents as they entered the U.S. In many cases,
                kids were left behind as their parents were deported. Others
                were literally lost in the system, with officials unable to
                match them to their guardians. Now, as a new administration
                takes over, they face an urgent challenge: how to reunite the
                hundreds of migrant children who remain separated from their
                families to this day. Drawing on his years of work within
                immigrant communities, filmmaker Oscar Guerra (Love, Life & the
                Virus) chronicles the struggle. With unique access to the
                families themselves, Guerra tells the story through their eyes,
                stripping away the politics and noise to create an intimate
                portrait of the parents who’d sought safety and opportunity in
                the U.S., only to have their families torn apart.

                  Sessions sent a memo to prosecutors along the border directing
                  them to criminally prosecute any immigrant who enters the United
                  States illegally. Under this policy, immigrant families

                  Sessions held press conferences in San Diego, Calif. and

                  “enforce the law without exception” and that they would separate
                  families who crossed together.
